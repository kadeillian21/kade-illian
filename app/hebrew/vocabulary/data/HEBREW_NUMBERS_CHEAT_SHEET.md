# Hebrew Numbers Cheat Sheet

## The Paradox: Gender Reversal 🤯

**Most confusing rule in Hebrew numbers:**
- **Masculine** number forms are used with **feminine** nouns
- **Feminine** number forms are used with **masculine** nouns

Examples:
- שְׁלֹשָׁה יָמִים (shloshah yamim) = "three (m) days" - but יוֹם (day) is masculine!
- שָׁלֹשׁ שָׁנִים (shalosh shanim) = "three (f) years" - but שָׁנָה (year) is feminine!

**Exception:** The number 1 and 2 sometimes follow normal gender agreement.

## How Hebrew Numbers Combine

### Numbers 11-19
Formed by combining the units + עָשָׂר/עֶשְׂרֵה (ten):
- 11 = אַחַד עָשָׂר (achat asar) - literally "one ten"
- 12 = שְׁנֵים עָשָׂר (shneim asar) - literally "two ten"
- 15 = חֲמִשָּׁה עָשָׂר (chamishah asar) - literally "five ten"

### Numbers 21-99
Formed by combining tens + units (like English "twenty-three"):
- 23 = עֶשְׂרִים וְשָׁלֹשׁ (esrim v'shalosh) - "twenty and three"
- 45 = אַרְבָּעִים וְחָמֵשׁ (arba'im v'chamesh) - "forty and five"
- 77 = שִׁבְעִים וְשִׁבְעָה (shiv'im v'shiv'ah) - "seventy and seven"

### Hundreds
- 100 = מֵאָה (me'ah)
- 200 = מָאתַיִם (matayim) - **dual form** (special!)
- 300 = שְׁלֹשׁ מֵאוֹת (shalosh me'ot) - "three hundreds" (plural)
- 400 = אַרְבַּע מֵאוֹת (arba me'ot)
- 500 = חֲמֵשׁ מֵאוֹת (chamesh me'ot)

### Thousands
- 1,000 = אֶלֶף (elef)
- 2,000 = אַלְפַּיִם (alpayim) - **dual form** (special!)
- 3,000 = שְׁלֹשֶׁת אֲלָפִים (shloshet alafim) - "three of thousands" (construct + plural)
- 5,000 = חֲמֵשֶׁת אֲלָפִים (chameset alafim)

### Complex Numbers
Largest units first, connected with וְ (and):
- 365 = שְׁלֹשׁ מֵאוֹת וְשִׁשִּׁים וְחָמֵשׁ
  - "three hundreds and sixty and five"

## Important Patterns

### The Plural Forms for Tens
Notice the pattern: Tens (20-90) are **plural forms** of the basic numbers:
- 20 = עֶשְׂרִים (esrim) - plural of 10
- 30 = שְׁלֹשִׁים (shloshim) - plural of 3
- 40 = אַרְבָּעִים (arba'im) - plural of 4
- etc.

### Ordinals
For ordinals (first, second, third):
- Only 1-10 have special ordinal forms (רִאשׁוֹן, שֵׁנִי, שְׁלִישִׁי...)
- Beyond 10, use cardinal numbers as adjectives
- Ordinals have masculine AND feminine forms (like adjectives)

## Theologically Significant Numbers

- 40 days flood, 40 years wilderness, 40 days Moses on Sinai
- Represents testing/trial/preparation

### 12 (שְׁנֵים עָשָׂר)
- Tribes of Israel, months, apostles
- Represents God's people/governance

### 70 (שִׁבְעִים)
- Nations of the world (Genesis 10)

- Years of exile

### 3 (שָׁלֹשׁ / שְׁלֹשָׁה)

## Reading Tips for Biblical Texts

1. **Numbers are ALWAYS written as words**, never digits (no "7", only שֶׁבַע)
2. **Look for the construct chain** with hundreds/thousands:
   - שְׁלֹשֶׁת (construct "three of") + noun
3. **Gender clues**: If you see a masculine number form, the noun is feminine!
4. **Context is key**: Ages, years, days help you know what numbers to expect

## Pro Tips

1. **Start with cardinals 1-10** - these are the foundation
2. **Learn the tens** - they're just plural forms
3. **Practice ordinals 1-7** - you'll see these constantly (creation story!)
4. **Memorize key numbers**: 7, 40, 12, 70 (theologically important)
5. **Don't stress about gender** - even native readers find it confusing at first!
